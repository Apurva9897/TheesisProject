## Project title: Stock Control System

### Student name: Apurva Vivek Kulkarni

### Student email: avk7@student.le.ac.uk

### Project description: 

The Stock Control System is a web-based application designed to manage and monitor stock levels of computer components in a computer warehouse. It ensures real-time inventory tracking, optimizes the stock assembly process, and enhances operational efficiency by providing accurate reporting and invoicing features. The system helps warehouse managers prevent stock shortages, reduce excess inventory, and improve overall productivity.
A key feature of this system is location tracking, which allows precise identification of where each item is stored or moved during stock assembly. Additionally, the system integrates computer services, including computer maintenance, system design, software development, software installation, and disaster recovery services, making it a comprehensive solution for IT asset management.
The application supports user roles and access control, ensuring secure handling of stock information. With automated alerts, reporting tools, and invoicing capabilities, the system helps businesses maintain financial records and optimize inventory operations. It also provides graphical insights into stock trends, supports multi-user access, and enables cloud-based deployment for scalability.
By implementing the Stock Control System, businesses can streamline inventory processes, enhance stock visibility, and ensure accurate record-keeping, ultimately improving warehouse efficiency and reducing operational risks.


### List of requirements (objectives): 

[comment]: # (You can add as many additional bullet points as necessary by adding an additional hyphon symbol '-' at the end of each list) 

Essential:
1.	Centralized Inventory Management System: The system allows businesses to track stock levels of computer components in real-time, ensuring accurate stock records. It helps prevent overstocking or stock shortages by dynamically updating inventory as items are added, removed, or relocated.

2.	Real-time Stock Movement and Location Tracking: Each itemâ€™s exact location within the warehouse is recorded and updated during the stock assembly process. This ensures efficient stock retrieval and prevents misplacement of inventory. Automated low-stock alerts and notifications.

3.	Automated Low-stock Alerts and Notifications: The system sends alerts when inventory levels reach predefined thresholds, enabling warehouse managers to reorder components before they run out. This minimizes downtime and prevents disruptions in operations.

4.	Role-based User Authentication and Access Control: Different user roles, such as admin, warehouse staff, and finance team, have specific permissions to ensure secure handling of stock data and transactions. Unauthorized access is restricted to maintain system security. Reporting and data visualization tools for inventory analysis.

5.	Reporting and Data Visualization Tools: Users can generate real-time inventory reports, track stock trends, and analyze stock movement history. Reports can be exported in formats like PDF, CSV, or Excel for business insights and audits. Secure database storage and backup solutions.
